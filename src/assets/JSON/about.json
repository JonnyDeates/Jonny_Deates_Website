      "Programmer, and I’ve been since my interest sparked at ten. I’ve done projects in Python, Html, Java, JS, Typescript, C#, Lua, nodeJs, Angular, XML, and React. I specialize in Typescript, and Angular for website development. Each website is catered to the client, as I work with them throughout the process. Often the designs, flow, css, and html will be made from scratch, while Typescript is always written from scratch. I also ensure the client’s have a personalized backend programs and/or app to allow for additional updates to the website. These programs and/or apps are written in React & JSX / XML & Java respectively.",
      "Pulling away from that portion of my life, I am also a Barista working at Starbucks. The job itself leaves me a little money starved but the intriguing interactions, wholesome connections, and just a family-like team make it important in my life. I work as a shift lead in a café only store, which I actively work to keep a positive and comfortable vibe in. I work a lot currently, but I do need to say I enjoy it. Eventually though I head home by biking ( I do drive if it’s terrible weather ).",
      "Multiple distant bike rides are a regular for me, and it helps keep me active. I do stretches, workout all throughout the day in broken segments, and bike pretty much anywhere in a ten mile radius. I enjoy pushing myself to better my overall health, and enjoy seeing the limits I have, gradually get pushed further and further back. The growth brings me confidence and joy and as such I strive to grow myself and those around me."
